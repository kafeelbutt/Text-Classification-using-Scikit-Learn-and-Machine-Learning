# Text-Classification-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the problem statement and the solution of that problem. I have classified the text based on the content of the text by using count vectorizer to transform the text into vectors and then apply ML algorithms to classify the text. Trained different algorithms and pickup the best classifier.
